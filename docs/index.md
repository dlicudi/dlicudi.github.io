# Welcome

Hi, I'm Duane.

I'm a Systems Integration Specialist and Developer with over 20 years of experience in UNIX/Linux environments. Over the past decade at Gibtelecom, I've specialised in developing and integrating systems, implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions, and achieving ISO 27001 compliance for secure development.

I'm passionate about coding, especially in Python, and I thrive on implementing solutions that require interfacing and integration.
